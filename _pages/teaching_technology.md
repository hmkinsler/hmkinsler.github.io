As an instructor, fostering engagement and community building in the classroom is the core value that informs my teaching. I find that students are regularly shocked at the beginning of the semester because I am constantly walking around the room, approaching their small groups to ask questions, stopping to look at their work, but within a week or two, this practice shifts the norm for the classroom environment in such a way that my students feel that there is less of a hierarchy between them and myself so that they know they can approach me at any time with questions and know that I am invested in their active engagement during our class sessions. I feel that engagement is essential for being an effective instructor because it helps drive student investment in their own learning so that they are actively making attempts at in-class activities and their assignments. I want my students to view me more as a mentor or a coach, someone who is non-judgmental and is invested in their progress and effort more than anything, which is particularly important for my students who come into the beginning of the semester expressing anxiety about writing and uncertainty about their ability to improve. For me, engagement is the basis for all of my teaching practice because, though important, even if the activities and assignments I offer align with the course goals, or even if they are diverse and accessible, if students are not engaged, they will not interact with the materials that are offered to them.

At the same time, in an age where technology and the digital are ever-present in the world and increasingly making their way into our built environment, I see more and more areas where I might 

Over the course of teaching ENG 101, I have continuously experimented with a variety of different tools, evaluating each tool to identify where it strikes a balance between efficiency and pedagogical efficacy. Whether this has involved the use of collaborative annotation using Perusall, developing shared Google Drive spaces where students can share and comment on each others' writing, or responding to my students with screenrecorded feedback, I have a deep interest in adapting digital platforms and technologies for use in my classroom.

Critical Technological Pedagogy, AI, & Digital Literacy in ENG 101
=====
As an interdisciplinary scholar and researcher, I often draw on my own educational background to interrogate the implications for the production and circulation of technologies in our world. I bring this perspective into my own teaching, making use of a critical pedagogy which Amy Bradhshaw defines as "[encompassing] educational approaches that are focused on empowering learners to be full participants in democratic society through eudcational practices that are connected to learners' own experiences, address issues directly and immediately relevant to learners and their communities, and seek to transform systems and structures that contribute to oppression and marginalization" (2017, p. 9). I see a critical approach to the use of technology in the classroom as being twofold: it requires that I am both critical of the tools that I employ in my course design as well as transparent in the selection and employment of those tools so that I can participate in a co-constructed critique of technology and digital media alongisde my students.

One such example of this two-fold approach to interrogating educational technologies was manifested in my Spring 2025 course following my attendance at a professional development workshop that was hosted by our First Year Writing Program entitled "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, Strategies for Navigating Generative AI in First-Year Composition." During the workshop, presenters Chad Lewis and Jackson Martin shared their experiences with Google Chrome Extensions such as [Revision History](https://www.revisionhistory.com/) and [Process Feedback](https://processfeedback.org/) that record keystrokes in Google Doc files and can provide information on any area where information has been copy and pasted, the amount of time spent on the file, and the like. Such tools are marketed for their ability to prevent plagiarism or unsanctioned uses of AI by students, but I found myself with more questions than answers following the end of the session. I wondered about the privacy and data implications for the use of such tools, whether the use of such a platform could put students' private information and writing as risk, or if students would feel as though they were being pre-emptively surveilled out of a fear of their potential misuse of AI. Such surveillance practices have become more common with the rise of technological corporations and the sale of personal information of data, as Zuboff (2015) notes. At the same time that I muddled through these thoughts, I remembered a recent lession about track changes and the role of revision in the writing process where I attempted to show my students the version history of a Google Doc for a paper I had written over the course of five months. I had intended to show them areas where I had gotten stuck in the middle of a sentence, moved a quote from one paragraph to another, or simply used placeholder text as filler so they could see my work as a potential model for how professional writers navigate the writing process in non-linear and recursive ways. This activity quickly failed, however, as the many months and writing sessions involved with the file made it impossible to track those changes from version to version for the document. After the workshop, I ended up presenting both Revision History and Process Feedback to my students as potential tools for evaluating their own writing processes, we repeated the activity for my paper with both of those tools, and we discussed some of the implications posed by some tools and the affordances they present in documenting the writing process as well as the limitations they pose if not critiqued for their surveillance and privacy risks.

This singular case encompasses a broader perspective of mine on the importance of promoting digital literacy in the classroom. As students prepare to move forward in their career paths beyond ENG 101, whether in their academic endeavors or through entering into industry, I situate my role as an instructor to both model various approaches to technology tool as well as make use of technology in innovative ways to help students reach learning objectives that I would like for them to continue to build on long after the semester is over. I resonate with Blevin's perspective on this pedagogy as "[focusing] less on the literacy of a particular version of a particular tool and more on broader composing processes" (2018, p. 22)

Such digital literacies are particular important with the rise of machine learning and generative-AI, in particular.

[DISCUSS FUTURE ENDEAVORS TO INTEGRATE AI INTO THE CLASSROOM -- COULD ADAPT FROM READING RESPONSE]

One pedagogical tool I am currently working on developing is a chatbot, which will aptly be called "profbot" that makes use of an LLM that I am fine-tuning on my own personal teaching data. This project is only in the early data collection, cleaning, and preparation stages for now, but I am essentially going through my own teaching and writing materials and ensuring there is no identifiable information within them, organizing the materials based on the units I teach in the class, and compiling feedback comments I have written to help train the LLM to act as an AI tool that can potentially stand in for minor questions that students have. I envision it being the kind of thing where a student can ask "what time are office hours and how do I find the building?" or "what does it mean in this assignment when I'm asked to explain how I would answer the 'so what?' question for readers in my conclusion?" To be able to do so, I would need the LLM to be trained on all of these routine aspects of my teaching practice, essentially creating a digital repository of my pedagogical *habitus* (Bourdieu, 1977) that students can prompt for basic information. I think it would be an interesting tool to potentially interrogate critically with my students since they could ask me questions about the choices I made in what data to include or exclude,  look at examples of hallucinations or incorrect responses that will undoubtedly be produced over the semester, discuss prompting strategies and what they reveal about the chatbot's design, and the chatroom would act as an exploratory site for interrogating the usage of AI as part of the academic writing process. Part of my hope here is that this would be a way for students to get more tailored formative feedback, which is something that due to constraints on my own time, energy, and labor, is not something I am able to provide enough of. Plus, they could prompt the chatbot for pictures of my cat.
