Over the course of teaching ENG 101, I have continuously experimented with a variety of different tools, evaluating each tool to identify where it strikes a balance between efficiency and pedagogical efficacy.

- EXPLAIN ISSUES OF AI IN TEACHING

One pedagogical tool I am currently working on developing is a chatbot, which will aptly be called "profbot" that makes use of an LLM that I am fine-tuning on my own personal teaching data. This project is only in the early data collection, cleaning, and preparation stages for now, but I am essentially going through my own teaching and writing materials and ensuring there is no identifiable information within them, organizing the materials based on the units I teach in the class, and compiling feedback comments I have written to help train the LLM to act as an AI tool that can potentially stand in for minor questions that students have. I envision it being the kind of thing where a student can ask "what time are office hours and how do I find the building?" or "what does it mean in this assignment when I'm asked to explain how I would answer the 'so what?' question for readers in my conclusion?" To be able to do so, I would need the LLM to be trained on all of these routine aspects of my teaching practice, essentially creating a digital repository of my pedagogical *habitus* (Bourdieu, 1977) that students can prompt for basic information. I think it would be an interesting tool to potentially interrogate critically with my students since they could ask me questions about the choices I made in what data to include or exclude,  look at examples of hallucinations or incorrect responses that will undoubtedly be produced over the semester, discuss prompting strategies and what they reveal about the chatbot's design, and the chatroom would act as an exploratory site for interrogating the usage of AI as part of the academic writing process. Part of my hope here is that this would be a way for students to get more tailored formative feedback, which is something that due to constraints on my own time, energy, and labor, is not something I am able to provide enough of. Plus, they could prompt the chatbot for pictures of my cat.
