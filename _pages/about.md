I am a PhD student in the Communications, Rhetoric, and Digital Media at North Carolina State University. I have been a three-time student at State, as I received both my B.A. and M.A. degrees in English here, so I am a proud supporter of the pack, and Tompkins Hall has become like a second home to me. Though originally born in Maryland, I have lived in Wake County since 2011 and can confidently say that North Carolina has become home. 

I have co-founded two research projects, including the North Carolina Trans and Nonbinary Language Project and the Fourth Ward Oral History Project. Though my work spans a variety of topics, I have a deep interest in the intersection between language and discourse analysis, digital humanities, public history and outreach, and the lives of marginalized people in the South. I approach my work from a scholar-activist framework, hoping to draw on the institutional resources I have been granted access to in pursuit of liberation through active, on-the-ground, engaged, and community-rooted research. Being in community with so many wonderful people in Raleigh and North Carolina has turned graduate student life in an absolute joy for me.

When I am not studying, teaching, or tinkering around on campus, I can often be found working on a car, taking photos at a local garden or arboretum, cooking with my partner, or reading with my wonderful tabby, Clover. I enjoy the DIY ethos that comes with many of my hobbies, and if it sounds like I can get myself elbow deep into an engine bay or play around with some code, I am all in.
