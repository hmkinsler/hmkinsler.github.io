<p>As part of my archival research and work with the [Fourth Ward Oral History Project](fourthwardhistory.org), I have been working on developing our process for obtaining, processing, and digitizing historical records relating to the urban renewal process in Raleigh. Using open-source designs, I built my own version of [the Archivist](https://diybookscanner.org/archivist/), a scanner design developed by Daniel Reetz and documented as part of the [DIY Book Scanning online community](https://www.diybookscanner.org/en/index.html).</p>
