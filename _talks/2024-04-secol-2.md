Talk Abstract
======

Popular representations of U.S. trans communities maintain that trans people in the U.S. South desire to move to large urban centers in the West and North. However, a growing body of research has explored how trans people have chosen to stay and make their lives in the South (Abelson 2019, Rogers 2020, Crowley 2023). Despite growing research on trans and nonbinary people in the region, the specific linguistic challenges of trans recognition in the Southeastern United States remain under-examined. In this presentation, we analyze fifteen sociolinguistic interviews collected as part of the North Carolina Trans and Nonbinary Language Project. These interviews were conducted with transgender, nonbinary, and gender diverse individuals currently living in North Carolina. We show how participants discursively navigate the tension of the changing sociopolitical climate of the South through Bakhtin’s (1981) concept of the chronotope, which highlights the ways that “space, time, and models of personhood are linked in narrative frameworks” (Rosa 2015, p.109).

In mainstream representations, the South is tied to “stereotypical qualities of moral and linguistic backwardness” (Chun 2018, p.425, emphasis ours), whereas queer life is often oriented to a queer futurity (Muñoz 2009). As interview participants grapple with whether or not it will remain hospitable to live in North Carolina for trans people, they draw on chronotopes that link trans life in the South to fraught pasts and possible futures. We find that, on the one hand, participants express worries about an anti-trans trajectory for the state. In this way, they narrate a temporal trajectory between previous NC state legislation, ongoing legislation in other states, and concerns about the future in NC. On the other hand, participants contest the chronotope of the “outdated” or “backwards” South and instead articulate the benefits of staying and building community in the region. 

As of August 2023, three bills (HB 808, HB 574, and SB 49) have been passed in North Carolina targeting trans children and trans people in sports, demonstrating that anti-trans sentiment in the region is ongoing. Importantly, we show how participants discursively link the challenges of the past, present, and future of trans life in North Carolina. By demonstrating how trans and nonbinary North Carolinians make meaning within the current political climate, we contribute to the growing field of trans linguistics (Zimman 2020) and make space for stories of trans and nonbinary people in the changing South.
