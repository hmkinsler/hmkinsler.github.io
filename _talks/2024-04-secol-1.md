Talk Abstract
======

Trans linguistics, a growing discipline, centers the lived experiences of transgender, nonbinary, and gender diverse people and allows them the space and agency to document their experiences with language (Zimman 2020). Previously, research on the linguistic practices of trans communities has focused on large cities in the Western and Northeastern United States, leading to erasure of the rich and complex lives of trans people who live in the Southern United States, leaving many of their experiences yet to be documented (Stone 2018). This erasure has contributed to a centering of the experiences of transgender communities in larger cities on the West Coast, with much to be explored about trans communities in other parts of the United States, particularly rural areas and regions that have experienced historical disinvestment.

In this paper, I use a discourse analysis approach to evaluate fifteen sociolinguistic interviews that were collected as part of the North Carolina Trans and Nonbinary Language Project. From these interviews, I show that transgender, nonbinary, and gender diverse people in North Carolina utilize a variety of discursive strategies to negotiate their orientation to Southern identity. Drawing on the stance alignment framework (Du Bois 2007), I show how participants take variable stances in relation to Southern identity. In some cases, participants rejected stigmatized characteristics that have been indexed to Southern identities, such as conservatism or anti-LGBTQIA+ sentiment. In other cases, participants indicated that their Southern identity allows them to combat these dominant social narratives, making the experiences of trans people in the South more visible. Overall, this paper explores the complex contextual circumstances and ideologies that speakers draw on while negotiating their identities as gender diverse people in relationship with Southern identity.

As a transgender researcher, my role in this analysis has been to shed light on the rich linguistic practices that I see members of my community in North Carolina engaging in, particularly given the historic anti-LGBTQIA+ sentiment associated with the South that positions LGBTQIA+ people in opposition to Southern identity (Smith 1997). This work highlights the linguistic agency of transgender communities in North Carolina and the ways in which people utilize language in acts of identity construction, resistance, and expressions of trans joy. Given the ongoing political tension in North Carolina around trans people, especially in the form of anti-trans legislation, this research seeks to illuminate our linguistic resilience in the changing Southern sociopolitical landscape.
